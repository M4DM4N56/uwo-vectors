# uwo-vectors

This program takes in a matrix and performs a series of outputs, such as multiplying the matrix by a vector and another matrix, inverting the matrix, turning the matrix to a string, and checking if it is equal to another matrix.

The program also computes if the given matrix is a valid markov chain, and it also computes the probability matrix
